# AudioUnitSDK

## Overview
The AudioUnitSDK contains a set of base classes as well as utility sources required for Audio Unit development. These utility classes extend or wrap Core Audio APIâ€™s providing developers with the essential scaffolding to create audio effects, instruments, and generators on Apple platforms. They provide an easier to implement C++ class model wrapping the C framework APIs.

2. Build the AudioUnitSDK target
